**JB** is currently a PhD student at [KAIST AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html). He delves into the true nature of deep learning through the lens of human cognitive systems, with a particular focus on how humans acquire, process, and apply knowledge. Before joining KAIST, JB led AI research for patent analysis and retrieval at Tanalysis. He obtained a Master’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence from Yonsei University, where he studied neural architectures and their foundations in formal language under the guidance of [Yo-Sub Han](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/~emmous/). Prior to his journey into AI research, JB worked as a software engineer at Samsung Electronics.

# Research Interests

JB's research focuses on how cognitive principles can advance deep learning toward genuine artificial intelligence. Specifically, his research involves:

- **Deep learning under the *Poverty of the Stimulus*** \
Unlike humans, who acquire knowledge from only a small amount of experience, today’s large models rely on massive data. His research aims to bridge this gap by seeking optimal learning algorithms that enable models to understand the world from limited exposure.

- **Neural architectures grounded in human cognition** \
To emulate the sophistication of human intelligence, neural architectures should be fundamentally aligned with human cognitive systems. His research draws on insights from cognitive science to explore foundational neural architectures that model human thought.

- **Knowledge representation in deep neural models** \
Despite the vast knowledge encoded in deep models, accessing and leveraging such knowledge remains a challenge. His research investigates how knowledge can be represented, accessed, and modified within deep neural models.
