**JB** is currently a PhD student at [KAIST AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html). He delves into the true nature of deep learning through the lens of human cognitive systems, with a particular focus on how humans acquire, process, and apply knowledge. Before joining KAIST, JB led AI research for patent analysis and retrieval at Tanalysis. He obtained a Master’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence from Yonsei University, where he studied neural architectures and their foundations in formal language under the guidance of [Yo-Sub Han](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/~emmous/). Prior to his journey into AI research, JB worked as a software engineer at Samsung Electronics.

# Research Interests

- **Neural Architectures Aligned with Human Cognition** \
Cognitive systems play a pivotal role in advancing neural architectures for perception, cognition and reasoning. His research aims to discover optimal neural architectures by aligning them with cognitive principles.

- **Knowledge Representation in Neural Models** \
Despite the vast knowledge stored in deep models, accessing and leveraging this knowledge remains a challenge. His research focuses on how knowledge can be represented, accessed, and modified within neural models.

- **Deep Learning under the Poverty of the Stimulus** \
Large language models achieve language comprehension through vast amounts of data, while humans acquire language from only a small amount of experience. His research investigates mechanisms within deep learning that support generalization from limited linguistic exposure.
