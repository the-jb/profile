**JB** is currently a PhD student at [KAIST AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html). He delves into the true nature of deep learning through the lens of human cognitive systems, specifically focusing on how humans acquire, process, and apply knowledge. Before joining KAIST, JB led AI research for patent analysis and retrieval at Tanalysis. He obtained a Master’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence from Yonsei University, where he studied neural architectures and their foundations in formal language under the guidance of [Yo-Sub Han](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/~emmous/). Prior to his journey into AI research, JB worked as a software engineer at Samsung Electronics.

# Research Interests

- **Designing Neural Architectures Modeled on Human Cognitive Systems** \
Cognitive systems play a pivotal role in advancing neural architectures for perception, cognition and reasoning. Research aims to reach optimal neural architectures by aligning them with human cognition.

- **Advancing Knowledge Access to Deep Models** \
Despite the vast knowledge stored in deep models, accessing and leveraging those knowledge remains a challenge. Research encompasses broad spectrum of knowledge for neural models, from information retrieval to understanding dynamics of complex reasoning.

- **Deep Learning for Language Acquisition with Minimal Data** \
Large language models (LLMs) achieve language comprehension through vast amounts of data, whereas humans can acquire language from only a small amount of experience, known as the "poverty of the stimulus" argument. Research seeks deep learning methods that can effectively learn language with limited data by leveraging linguistic features.
