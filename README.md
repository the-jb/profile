# Research Interests

- **Designing Neural Architectures Modeled on Human Cognitive Systems** \
*Cognitive systems play a pivotal role in advancing neural architectures for perception, cognition and reasoning. Research aims to reach optimal neural architectures by aligning them with human cognition.*

- **Advancing Control over Knowledge in Models** \
*Despite the vast knowledge stored in deep models, accessing and leveraging those knowledge remains a challenge. Research encompasses broad spectrum of knowledge for neural models, from information retrieval to understanding dynamics of complex reasoning.*

- **Deep Learning for Language Acquisition with Minimal Data** \
*Large language models (LLMs) achieve language comprehension through vast amounts of data, whereas humans can acquire language from only a small amount of experience, known as the "poverty of the stimulus" argument. Research seeks deep learning methods that can effectively learn language with limited data by leveraging linguistic features.*
